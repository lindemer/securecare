/*
 *  Description:
 *      This file implements the Secure Hash Algorithms
 *      as defined in the U.S. National Institute of Standards
 *      and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
 *      Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-3 published in October 2008
 *      and formerly defined in its predecessors, FIPS PUB 180-1
 *      and FIP PUB 180-2.
 *
 *      A combined document showing all algorithms is available at
 *              http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/
 *                     fips180-3/fips180-3_final.pdf
 *
 *      The five hashes are defined in these sizes:
 *              SHA-1           20 byte / 160 bit
 *              SHA-224         28 byte / 224 bit
 *              SHA-256         32 byte / 256 bit
 *              SHA-384         48 byte / 384 bit
 *              SHA-512         64 byte / 512 bit
 *
 *  Compilation Note:
 *    These files may be compiled with two options:
 *        USE_32BIT_ONLY - use 32-bit arithmetic only, for systems
 *                         without 64-bit integers
 *
 *        USE_MODIFIED_MACROS - use alternate form of the SHA_Ch()
 *                         and SHA_Maj() macros that are equivalent
 *                         and potentially faster on many systems
 *
