 *  Description:
 *      This is the header file for code which implements the Secure
 *      Hashing Algorithm 1 as defined in FIPS PUB 180-1 published
 *      April 17, 1995.
 *
 *      Many of the variable names in this code, especially the
 *      single character names, were used because those were the names
 *      used in the publication.
 *
 *      Please read the file sha1.c for more information.
 *
 * This SHA-1 implementation is ported by An Liu from the example code
 * in RFC 3174
